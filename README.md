# Project Title

car_struct

## Description
defines a smart contract named "CarsContract" that manages a collection of cars. It includes a public dictionary variable called "Cars," where each entry is a key-value pair with a string key representing the car model and a corresponding value of type "Car." The "Car" struct has three properties: "Model" (String), "Year" (Int), and "Price" (Int). The contract provides an initializer for creating a new car instance and a function, "addCar," to add cars to the collection. The contract initializes an empty dictionary of cars in its own initialization.
